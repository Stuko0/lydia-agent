"""Tests for the git-askpass long-poll route. The endpoint is what lets
git's `GIT_ASKPASS` shim raise a credential prompt in the desktop
renderer instead of the terminal where the user launched the app.

The route is special: it blocks the HTTP request until the renderer
responds (or 5 minutes elapse). We test the contract by spawning the
endpoint handler in a thread and asserting the long-poll behaviour."""
